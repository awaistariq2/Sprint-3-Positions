    <p>This section is here to create enough content to make the page scrollable. As you scroll down, notice a few things:</p>
    <p>The header at the very top has position: sticky. It scrolls with the content until it hits the top of the viewport, where it ‘sticks’ in place.</p>
    <p>The profile card also has position: relative. By itself, this doesn’t do much, but it creates a positioning context for its child elements.</p>
    <p>The red notification badge has position: absolute, which positions it relative to the boundaries of the profile card, its nearest ‘positioned’ ancestor.  </p>
